## Language Support

This application supports both Japanese and English languages, adapting to the device's language settings.

## Features

- **Four-Level Satisfaction Rating:** Users can record their satisfaction level by tapping one of four emoji buttons:
    - üòä Very Satisfied
    - üôÇ Satisfied
    - üòê Unsatisfied
    - üò† Very Unsatisfied
- **Cooldown Mechanism:** To prevent accidental or fraudulent multiple clicks, there is a 5-second cooldown period after a button is pressed.
- **Timestamped Data Logging:** Each rating is saved with a precise timestamp.
- **Offline Operation:** The app works completely offline. No internet connection is required.
- **In-App Log Viewer:** View all recorded survey logs directly within the app.
- **Data Sharing/Export:** Easily share the `survey_log.csv` file with other applications (e.g., email, cloud storage) for further analysis.

## How to Use

1.  Launch the app on your Android tablet.
2.  Tap one of the four emoji buttons to record your feedback.
3.  A "Thank you" message will appear, and the buttons will be disabled for 5 seconds.
4.  After 5 seconds, the app is ready to receive the next feedback.
5.  **To view logs:** Tap the menu icon (three lines) in the top right corner of the survey screen.
6.  **To share logs:** On the log viewer screen, tap the share icon (arrow) in the top right corner and choose your preferred sharing method.

## Data Storage

- The survey data is stored in a CSV file named `survey_log.csv`.
- **File Location:** The file is located in the app's internal storage directory. You can typically access it using a file manager app (requires Android Studio's Device File Explorer for direct access on Android 11+):
  `/Android/data/com.example.local_survey/files/survey_log.csv`
- **CSV Format:** The data is stored in the following format:
  `timestamp,rating`
  (e.g., `2025-07-25 10:30:00,Very Satisfied`)
